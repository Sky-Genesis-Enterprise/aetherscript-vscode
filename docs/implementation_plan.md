# ArgusScript Implementation Plan: Pilot Version

This document outlines a practical implementation plan for creating a pilot version of ArgusScript that demonstrates its core concepts and unique features.

## Goals for the Pilot Version

The pilot version aims to:

1. Demonstrate the feasibility of the language design
2. Showcase the unique combinations of Python-like syntax, Go-like concurrency, and integrated UI/CSS
3. Create a minimal working environment for testing and demonstration
4. Serve as a proof of concept for further development

## Feature Scope

The pilot version will include:

### Core Language
- Basic types: Int, Float, String, Boolean, Array
- Variables and constants
- Functions with basic parameter handling
- Control flow: if/elif/else, for, while

## Technical Stack

The pilot implementation will use:

1. **Python** for the compiler frontend, interpreter, and tools
   - Makes rapid development possible
   - Good library ecosystem
   - Easy to extend and modify

2. **JavaScript/HTML/CSS** as a compilation target for UI
   - Universal browser support
   - No additional dependencies
   - Easy debugging and inspection

3. **Python asyncio** for concurrency simulation
   - Built-in async/await support
   - Similar concepts to Go's concurrency model
   - Well-documented and stable

## Development Process

1. **Incremental Development**
   - Focus on getting small pieces working before moving on
   - Regular integration to maintain a working system
   - Continuous testing throughout development

2. **Test-Driven Development**
   - Create test cases before implementation
   - Ensure language feature correctness
   - Facilitate refactoring and extension

3. **Documentation-First Approach**
   - Write specifications before code
   - Keep documentation in sync with implementation
   - Make learning the language easy

+------------------+    +------------------+
```

### UI Component Generation

For the pilot version, UI components will be transpiled to HTML/CSS:

1. UI blocks will generate HTML elements
2. Properties will translate to HTML attributes
3. Style blocks will generate CSS rules
4. Events will create JavaScript event handlers

Sample code:
```argus
fn Button(text: String, onClick: fn()) {
  ui {
    button(class="primary-btn", onClick=onClick) {
      text
    }
  }

  style {
    .primary-btn {
      background: #3498db
      color: white
      padding: 0.5rem 1rem
      border-radius: 0.25rem
    }
  }
}
```

Generated output:
```html
<button class="primary-btn">Button Text</button>
<style>
.primary-btn {
  background: #3498db;
  color: white;
  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
  border-radius: 0.25rem;
}
</style>
<script>
document.querySelector('.primary-btn').addEventListener('click', function() {
  // Call the onClick function
});
</script>
```

### Concurrency Implementation

The pilot version will use a simple concurrency model:

1. `go` keyword will spawn Python asyncio tasks
2. Channels will be implemented using asyncio queues
3. Synchronization will use asyncio primitives
4. Runtime will include a simple scheduler

Sample code:
```argus
fn main() {
  let ch = chan<String>()

  go fn() {
    for i in 0..5 {
      ch <- f"Message {i}"
      time.sleep(1)
    }
    close(ch)
  }()

  for msg in ch {
    print(msg)
  }
}
```

## Expected Outcomes

By the end of this implementation plan, we will have:

1. A working ArgusScript interpreter
2. The ability to run basic programs with UI components
3. Simple concurrency demonstrations
4. A clear path forward for full language implementation

## Next Steps After Pilot

After completing the pilot version, the project should focus on:

1. Performance optimizations
2. Compilation to native code
3. Extended standard library
4. Full type system with generics
5. Package management
6. Developer tools
7. Self-hosting compiler
